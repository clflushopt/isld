Data structures to implement if we had to start from the beginning.

This repository contains experimental implementations of things like [`quickselect`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect),
[Eytzinger's lower bound for binary search](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/data-structures/binary-search/) and
the [NBLFQ: lock-free MPMC queue](https://inria.hal.science/hal-04851700v2/file/article-final.pdf).

There are probably things I would put here like [rank and select](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs166/cs166.1226/lectures/14/Slides14.pdf)
[Folly's hazard pointers](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/synchronization/Hazptr.h) or
[Bonwick's allocator](http://www.parrot.org/sites/www.parrot.org/files/vmem.pdf).
